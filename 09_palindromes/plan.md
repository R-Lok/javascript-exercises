trim whitespace from string to get rid of spaces

turn string into array

get length of array

get mid point of the length = array.length/2, use math.floor to round down, since if it is an odd number of letters the letter in the exact middle does not need to be checked

compare first array element with last array element

increment first array element, decrement last array element, compare again

stop when i = array.length/2 - 1


Reminders to self (reflection):

Remember to use return statement to stop the loop.
