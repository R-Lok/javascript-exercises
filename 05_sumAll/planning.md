create sum variable to contain the sum. Start at 0
get all numbers between num1 and num2 via.. loop from num1 to num2
for each loop, add current num to the sum variable
return sum at tend of loop


What if num2 is bigger than num1?
Do a check at the start if num1 > num2
If not, store num2 in temp2
num2 = num1
num1 = temp2

then proceed with the loop
